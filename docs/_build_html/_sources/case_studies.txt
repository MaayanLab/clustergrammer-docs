Case Studies
------------
Clustergrammer was build to visualize high-dimensional biological data, e.g. genome-wide expression data, but is general enough to visualize any type of high dimensional data. Clustergrammer can visualize matrices of size ~500,000 - 1,000,000 matrix-cells (and is optimized to handle matrices with more rows than columns).
