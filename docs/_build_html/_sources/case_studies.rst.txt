Case Studies and Tutorials
--------------------------
Clustergrammer was developed to visualize high-dimensional biological data (e.g. genome-wide expression data), but it can also generally be applied to any high-dimensional data. Below are links to several case studies and examples using Clustergrammer to explore high-dimensional data. All examples are below are publically available through GitHub.

Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful method to interrogate gene expression across thousands of single cells. This method provides thousands of measurements (single cells) across thousands of dimensions (genes). Clustergrammer2 is used to interactively explore an example dataset of 2,700 PBMCs obtained from `10X Genomics`_. Bulk gene expression signatures of cell types obtained from `CIBERSORT`_ were used to obtain a tentative cell type for each cell. The data and code can be found on GitHub at `clustergrammer2-notebooks`_ and the notebook can be viewed and re-run on the cloud - see below.

Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Gene Expression Data

  Screenshot from the `CCLE Explorer`_ showing the tissue breakdown of the CCLE. Clicking on a tissue brings up an interactive heatmap with the top 250 most variable genes within a tissue. Also see the `CCLE Jupyter Notebook`_ for an example of how to explore the CCLE gene expression data in a Jupyter notebook.

The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (`CCLE`_) is a publicly available project that has characterized (e.g. genetic characterization) over 1,000 cancer cell lines. We used Clustergrammer to re-analyze and visualize CCLE's gene expression data in the `CCLE Explorer`_. The CCLE Explorer allows users to explore the CCLE by tissue type and visualize the most commonly differentially expressed genes for each tissue type as an interactive heatmap. The `CCLE Jupyter Notebook`_ generates an overview of the CCLE gene expression data, investigates specific tissues, and explains how to use :ref:`Enrichrgram <enrichrgram>` to understand the biological functions of differentially expressed genes.

Lung Cancer Post-Translational Modification and Gene Expression Regulation
==========================================================================

  Screenshot from the `CST_Data_Viz.ipynb`_ Jupyter notebook showing hierarchical clustering of differential phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, and gene expression data across 37 lung cancer cell lines. See the interactive Jupyter notebook `CST_Data_Viz.ipynb`_ for more information.

Lung cancer is a complex disease that is known to be regulated at the post-translational modification (PTM) level, e.g. phosphorylation driven by kinases. Our collaborators at `Cell Signaling Technology Inc`_ used Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) mass spectrometry to measure differential phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation in a panel of 42 lung cancer cell lines compared to non-cancerous lung tissue. Gene expression data from 37 of these lung cancer cell lines was also independently obtained from the publicly available Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (`CCLE`_). In the Jupyter notebook `CST_Data_Viz.ipynb`_ we:

- Visualize PTM data, gene expression data, and merged PTM/gene-expression data
- Identify co-regulated clusters of PTMs/genes in distinct lung cancer cell line subtypes
- Perform enrichment analysis to understand the biological processes involved in PTM/expression clusters

Single Cell CyTOF Dataset

  Screenshot from the `Plasma_vs_PMA_Phosphrylation.ipynb`_ Jupyter notebook showing downsampled single cell CyTOF data (K-means downsampled from 220,000 single cells to 2,000 cell-clusters). Cell-clusters are shown as rows with cell-type categories (e.g. Natural Killer cells) and phosphorylations are shown as columns. See the interactive Jupyter notebook `Plasma_vs_PMA_Phosphrylation.ipynb`_ for more information.

Our collaborators in the `Giannarelli Lab`_ and the `Icahn School of Medicine Human Immune Monitoring Core`_ used Mass Cytometry, CyTOF (Fluidigm), to investigate the phosphorylation response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) immune cells exposed to PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), a tumor promoter and activator of protein kinase C (PKC). A total of 28 markers (18 surface markers and 10 phosphorylation markers) were measured in over 200,000 single cells. In the Jupyter notebook `Plasma_vs_PMA_Phosphrylation.ipynb`_ we semi-automatically identify cell types using surface markers and cluster cells based on phosphorylation to identify cell-type specific behavior at the phosphorylation level. See the `Plasma_vs_PMA_Phosphrylation.ipynb`_ Jupyter notebook for more information.

Large Network: Kinase Substrate Similarity Network

  Screenshot from the `Kinase Substrate Similarity Network`_ example that demonstrates how Clustergrammer can be used to visualize a large network of kinases based on shared substrates.

Clustergrammer can be used to visualize large networks without the formation of 'hairballs'. In the `Kinase Substrate Similarity Network`_ example we use Clustergrammer to visualize a network kinases based on shared substrate that includes 404 kinases and 163,216 links. Kinases are shown as rows and columns. For more information see the `Kinase Substrate Similarity Network`_ example.

Machine Learning and Miscellaneous Datasets
===========================================

  Screenshot from the `MNIST Notebook`_ that demonstrates how the :ref:`clustergrammer_widget` can be used to visualize the `MNIST Data`_. Downsampled handwritten digits (K-means downsampled from 70,0000 handwritten digits to 300 digit-clusters) are shown as columns with digit-type categories and pixels are shown as rows. For more information see the `MNIST Notebook`_.

Clustergrammer was used to visualize several widely used machine learning Datasets and other miscellaneous Datasets:

- `MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset`_
- `Iris Flower Dataset`_
- `USDA Nutrient Dataset`_

These examples demonstrate the generality of heatmap visualizations and enable users to interactively explore familiar Datasets.
