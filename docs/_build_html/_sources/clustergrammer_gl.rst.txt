Clustergrammer-GL
-----------------

Clustergrammer-GL is the new in-development WegGL front end JavaScript library. This new library can visualize much larger datasets (matrices with ~millions of matrix-cells) and is being utilized by the new in-development Jupyter Widget, Clustergrammer2.


Clustergrammer-GL is being built using the WebGL library `regl`_, is free and open-source, and can be found on `GitHub`_.

Check back soon for more updates.
