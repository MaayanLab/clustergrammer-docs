Introduction
============
Clustergrammer is an interactive web-based tool for visualizing high-dimensional data as hierarchically clustered heatmap. Clustergrammer can be used in three main ways: 1) web application, Jupyter notebook interactive widget, and JavaScript and Python libraries. This section will provide quick instructions on how to

=====================================
Here is a link to a notebook with an example interactive widget hosted on nbviewer:

Interacting with Clustergrammer
===============================
Clustergrammer is built to enable users to intuitively explore/analyze high-dimensional datasets and has many interactive features including:

- zooming/panning
- row and column reordering (e.g. reorder based on sum)
- interactive dendrogram
- dimensionality reduction (e.g. filter rows based on variance)a
- interactive row/column categories
- cropping

Clustergrammer also have biology specific features including:

- mouseover gene (row) names to show the full name and description of a gene (through `Harmonizome`_)
- find biological information (e.g. up-stream transcription factors) specific to your gene list using enrichment analysis through `Enrichr`_

Getting Started Clustergrammer.js Web Development
=================================================
Clustergrammer can be used to generate a interactive visualizations for your web application. Clustergrammer consists of two parts:

#. the front-end Clustergrammer.js JavaScript library makes the interactive visualization
#. the back-end Clustergrammer.py Python library clusters a matrix of data and makes the JSON for the front-end

These libraries can be installed npm, ``npm install Clustergrammer``, and pip, ``pip install clustergrammer``, respectively.


The easiest way to generate a visualize of your own data on a webpage is to:

#. follow the :ref:`python_workflow_example` to cluster your matrix and generate the front-end JSON
#. then use the :ref:`example_pages` workflow to visualize your calculated JSON
