Case Studies and Examples
-------------------------
Clustergrammer was built to visualize biological data but is generally applicable for visualizing high-dimensional data. Below are links to several example case studies and examples using Clustergrammer:

Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Gene Expression Data
==================================================
The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (`CCLE`_) is a publicly available project that characterized (e.g. genetic characterization) over one thousand cancer cell lines. We used Clustergrammer to re-analyze and visualize CCLE's gene expression data in the `CCLE Explorer`_. The CCLE Explorer allows users to explore the CCLE by tissue type and visualize the most commonly differentially expressed genes for each tissue type as an interactive heatmap.

Zika Virus RNA-seq Data Visualization
=====================================
Clustergrammer was used to visualize the results of an RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline within a Jupyter notebook: `An open RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline tutorial with an example of reprocessing data from a recent Zika virus study`_ (`Wang et al.`_).

Single Cell RNA-seq Data Visualization
======================================
Clustergrammer was used to visualize published single-cell gene expression data: `Single Cell RNA-seq Data Visualization`_ (`Olsson et al.`_). The visualization was produced using an excel file provided alongside the figures.

Machine Learning Datasets
=========================
Clustergrammer was used to visualize two widely used labeled machine learning datasets:

- `Iris flower dataset`_
- `MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset`_

These examples demonstrate the generatlity of heatmap visualizations and enable users to interactively explore familiar datasets.
